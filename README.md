# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This repository now contains a simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game uses a minimax-based AI so the computer plays optimally.

## Running the Game

```bash
python tictactoe.py
```

On your turn, enter a number from 0-8 corresponding to the board position:

```
0 | 1 | 2
---+---+---
3 | 4 | 5
---+---+---
6 | 7 | 8
```

## Running Tests

The project includes a few basic tests for the game logic. Run them with:

```bash
pytest
```
